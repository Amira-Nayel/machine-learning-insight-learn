## Data Processing and Synthetic Data Generation Script

Overview

This script performs the following steps:
1.	Reads the original data from a CSV file.
2.	Inspects and prints the DataFrame's column names.
3.	Checks for and removes a specific column ("SA&D Midterm Grade") if it exists.
4.	Generates synthetic data by perturbing the original data.
5.	Writes the new synthetic data to a new CSV file.

Requirements

•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas library
•	NumPy library

Usage
File: syntheticdata.py
1.	Run the Script:
o	Execute the script using a Python interpreter. For example
                                 python generate_synthetic_data.py
Script Details
Step 1: Read the Original Data
The script reads the original data from a CSV file specified by the file_path variable.
file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/fffffffff.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path, delimiter='\t')
Step 2: Inspect DataFrame Columns
The script prints the column names of the original DataFrame to verify them.
print("Original Columns:", data.columns)
Step 3: Remove Specific Column
If the column "SA&D Midterm Grade" exists, it will be removed from the DataFrame.
column_to_remove = "SA&D Midterm Grade"
if (column_to_remove in data.columns):
    data = data.drop(columns=[column_to_remove])
else:
    print(f"Column '{column_to_remove}' not found in DataFrame.")
Step 4: Generate Synthetic Data
The script generates synthetic data by perturbing the numerical values of the original data.
def generate_synthetic_data(data, num_samples):
    synthetic_data = data.copy()
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        synthetic_sample = data.sample()
        for col in synthetic_sample.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns:
            synthetic_sample[col] += np.random.normal(0, 0.1)
        synthetic_data = pd.concat([synthetic_data, synthetic_sample], ignore_index=True)
    return synthetic_data

synthetic_data = generate_synthetic_data(data, 100)
Step 5: Save Synthetic Data
The generated synthetic data is saved to a new CSV file.
synthetic_data.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/fffffffff (2).csv', index=False, sep='\t')

Notes
•	Modify the number of synthetic samples (num_samples) as needed.
